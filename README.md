# SC649_Turtlebot
This repository is for the final running code of our team's project for SC649- Embedded Control and Robotics. The project was developed by Manan Mehta, Ayush Prasad, and Dhriti Maniar in collaboration.
The project works upon TurtleBot3 and implementing an Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) to estimate the Robot's pose.
